This Project can help identify the objects throughout the live feed and can be explicitly used for the Security though it was made for my Drone project.
The items identified through this program is mentioned under "coco.names" file. Though many items can be added to this file for the program to detect many innumberable number of objects, the config (ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt) & weight (frozen_inference.graph.pb) are the backbone files of this project.
